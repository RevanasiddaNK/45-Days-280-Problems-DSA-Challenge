# DSA Problem Solved Repository

Welcome to my **DSA Problem Solved Repository**, where I have compiled solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems solved through **LeetCode Contests**. This repository serves as a quick reference for revision, with each problem containing the problem statement, solution, and notes on the time and space complexity of my approach.

## Repository Structure

The repository is in each file corresponds to a specific problem and contains:
- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem as presented on LeetCode.
- **Solution Code**: My implementation of the solution.
- **Time Complexity**: Analyzed time complexity for the solution.
- **Space Complexity**: Analyzed space complexity for the solution.

## Problem Sources

- **LeetCode Contests**: All problems in this repository are sourced from LeetCode's live contests, where I attempt to solve problems during contests.

## How to Use This Repository

Simply browse the files to find solutions. Each file is named according to the problem title or a description for easier identification. Inside each file, you will find:
- The problem statement,
- My solution code, and
- A note on time and space complexity for that solution.
