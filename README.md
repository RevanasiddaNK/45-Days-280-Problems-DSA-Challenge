# DSA Problem Solved Repository

Welcome to my **DSA Problem Solved Repository**, where I have compiled solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. These problems are sourced from **LeetCode Contests** and **Arsh Goyal's DSA Sheet**. This repository is intended for quick reference and revision, providing a clear breakdown of each problem along with its solution and time-space complexity analysis.

## Repository Structure

Each directory corresponds to a specific problem and includes:
- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem.
- **Solution Code**: My implementation of the solution.
- **Time Complexity**: Analyzed time complexity for the solution.
- **Space Complexity**: Analyzed space complexity for the solution.

## Problem Sources

1. **LeetCode Contests**: Problems solved during LeetCode's live contests.
2. **Arsh Goyal's DSA Sheet**: A curated set of essential DSA problems for technical interviews.

## How to Use This Repository

Each file is named based on the problem title or description. Inside, you will find:
- The problem statement,
- Solution code, and
- Notes on time and space complexity.

This repository is ideal for quick revision before interviews.
